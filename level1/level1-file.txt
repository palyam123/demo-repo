3. Undoing Mistakes (BEFORE COMMIT)

This is where most beginners panic.

A. Unstage a file (keep changes)
git reset HEAD file.txt


Example 1

git add file.txt
git reset HEAD file.txt


Result

File goes back to working directory

Changes are NOT lost

Example 2

git reset


➡ Unstages everything

B. Discard changes completely (DANGEROUS)
git checkout -- file.txt


Example 1

nano file.txt
git checkout -- file.txt


➡ File restored to last commit

Example 2

git checkout -- .


➡ Discards ALL uncommitted changes

⚠ This is irreversible

C. Full restore workflow (from class)
git reset HEAD file.txt
git checkout -- file.txt


➡ File goes back to exact previous committed state
